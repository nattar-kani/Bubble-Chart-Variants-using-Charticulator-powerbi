# Bubble Chart Variants using Charticulator | Power BI
## Top 3 states in India with highest GI Tags
The Bubble Chart Variants project created using Charticulator showcases the top three states in India with the highest number of Geographical Indication (GI) tags in both the years 2005 and 2023. The project was developed as part of the Week 25 challenge from Workout Wednesday.  

By leveraging the power of Charticulator, the visualization displays the states as bubbles, where the size of each bubble represents the number of GI tags associated with that particular state. The chart provides a comparative analysis of the changes in the number of GI tags between the two years, allowing viewers to identify the states that have experienced significant growth or decline in GI tag registrations.
